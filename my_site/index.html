			<h2>About</h2>
			<div>
				<p>Liam, pronounced as LEE-am, is a boy's name with its origins in the Irish Gaelic language. It is derived from the common Irish name Guilielm, which over time became Guillaume, which in term eventually became Uilliam. The English version of the latter is the popular name William. The original Gaelic word from which it comes can be translated in a variety of different ways, but essentially the all stress the idea of a positive defender or warrior. Therefore, interpretations of Liam can be 'strong willed defender', 'strong willed warrior', or something as simple as just 'defender'. Alternatively, the name can be traced back further, past its Irish origins in Gaelic, to its Frankish roots in the form of the name Willahelm which then was later developed within Ireland to Guilielm. Thus, the original meaning of the name Liam requires a translation of the name Willahelm, which is a compound name of two Old German words:  'vila' which means 'will' or 'resolution', and 'helma' which means 'helmet'. This interpretation would lead us to suggest that Liam is a development of a name meaning 'Helmet of will'.</p>
